title: "Clock and Data Recovery (CDR)"
description: "Theory, intuition, and system-level modeling of CDR architectures used in high-speed SerDes."
---

This section focuses on **Clock and Data Recovery (CDR)** architectures used in
high-speed serial links.

Topics include:

- Bang-Bang CDR intuition and nonlinearity
- Phase detector behavior and jitter amplification
- Loop dynamics and bandwidth trade-offs
- Practical implementation issues in silicon

All content is written from a **system-level and modeling perspective**, with
MATLAB-based simulations where appropriate.
